 <summary><h3> Alecia's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I embarked on my journey in marketing and email development out of necessity and curiosity during my time at Notable Growth. As a startup, our engineering team was stretched thin, and I saw an opportunity to alleviate some of their workload by learning the basics of front-end development and API configurations myself. With the guidance of a senior solutions architect, I dove into HTML, CSS, Liquid scripting, and JavaScript, transforming from a novice to a resourceful problem-solver.

My passion for self-improvement led me to pursue my Braze Certified Marketer certification, and I quickly became proficient in coding emails, building templates, and creating automation workflows. One of my proudest moments was managing the Tech for Black Founders initiative, where I took on a multifaceted role that encompassed marketing consulting, portal setup, email templating, and lifecycle journey planning for Student Athlete, a startup that resonated deeply with me.

Inspired by my own experience as a student athlete, I continued to work with Student Athlete Co., helping bridge the gap for athletes transitioning into the corporate world. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack engineer, continuously learning and applying new skills to support innovative projects and startups. I'm currently expanding my expertise with Python and have my sights set on mastering React.

Challenges motivate me to grow and excel. I thrive on solving problems, overcoming obstacles, and connecting with diverse individuals through shared learning experiences. My journey is defined by a relentless drive to improve, a commitment to helping others, and an unwavering curiosity that keeps me exploring new horizons.
